Character Data: Store info like name, bio, avatar, NSFW status, and base stats.

Unlocking: Characters can be unlocked by players based on certain conditions—level, achievements, or random chance.

Levels & Progression: Characters have levels; leveling up requires meeting criteria (e.g., player level, affection points). Progression can unlock abilities or content.

Affection & Relationships: Track affection levels or bonds with characters, affecting dialogue or bonuses.

Random Unlocks: Sometimes characters unlock randomly with weighted chances, adding surprise.

Filtering: NSFW content can be toggled on/off depending on user settings.

Avatar Management: Each character can have one or more avatars, possibly changing with level or events.

Personality Traits: Characters have defined personalities that affect AI chat tone and behavior.



---

2. Upgrade Management

Upgrades let characters grow stronger or gain new features, tied to level or other requirements.

Upgrade Catalog: Maintain a list of possible upgrades per character or globally.

Unlock Criteria: Upgrades require players to reach certain levels or have other upgrades unlocked.


Removal/Reset: Allow upgrades to be removed or reset for flexibility.

Composite Checks: Upgrades may require complex conditions (e.g., level 3 AND affection 5).

Bonus Calculation: Keep track of all upgrade bonuses to calculate final character power.



---

Fallbacks: Provide default images or placeholders when media fails to load.



---

4. AI Chat Management

The heart of dynamic interaction—characters talk, remember, and adapt.

Personality Profiles: Each character has a base personality dictating tone, humor, empathy, etc.

Triggers & Events: Detect keywords or events that alter AI responses or start special dialogue.

Moods: AI maintains a mood state that changes based on conversation flow.

Custom Player Replies: Store preferred user responses to personalize conversations.

ClassikLust Game — Deep-Dive Feature Breakdown & Structure


---

1. Leveling System (Based on Upgrade Requirements)

Level progression does NOT just depend on raw points — it’s strictly tied to upgrades the player has purchased/unlocked.

Each level requires completing a set of upgrade prerequisites — e.g.,
To reach Level 5: You must have all Level 4 upgrades purchased.

This makes leveling a checklist, not just XP grind — adds strategy and progression gating.

Bonus: Leveling unlocks access to higher-tier upgrades and new characters or content.

The system should show which upgrades remain to hit next level to encourage goal-driven gameplay.



---

2. Character Management (Complex, Custom Personality & AI-Driven)

Characters are living entities in your game, with tons of custom attributes to make them feel unique, dynamic, and reactive.

Must-Have Character Data Fields:

Basic Info:

name (string)

bio (string) — short, lore-heavy background

avatarUrl (string) — main display picture


Personality Hardcoded Values:

Traits (e.g., sarcasm, kindness, bluntness) — numeric scale or weighted percentages

Mood States (happy, annoyed, flirty, etc.) — dynamic values that shift during conversation or events

Special Triggers — keywords or phrases in player chat that unlock unique responses or events

Min/Max Chat Delay — controls AI reply speed, to feel more natural or snappy


AI Chat Logic:

Primary responses come from hardcoded personality data and scripted dialogue trees (fallback/core)

Secondary: Use OpenAI or Gemini AI to generate dynamic, fresh replies

Fallback to hardcoded dialogue if API fails or to maintain character consistency


Unlock & Progression:

unlocked (boolean) — if player can access this character

level (int) — character’s own progression, can unlock new pics or dialogue

unlockConditions — by player level, events, achievements, or random weighted chance


Content Flags:

nsfw (boolean) — character or pictures marked NSFW

NSFW toggle available globally for players (turn on/off NSFW content)


Picture Management:

Store multiple images per character, tagged with:

Level required

Event tied to

VIP-only or general access

NSFW flag


Random chance percentages to send a picture in chat or show in gallery


Personality Modifiers:

Allow mood and personality to shift based on player interaction history or timed events

Implement affection or relationship metrics that influence chat tone or bonuses




---

3. Image Management

Images aren’t just static content — they need to be carefully curated, gated, and tagged.

Key Features:

By event (holiday, seasonal, special promotions)

By VIP status (exclusive images only for VIP players)

By NSFW toggle — filtered out if player disables NSFW

Access Control:

Enforce gating logic both frontend (UI) and backend (API) so players only see what they qualify for
